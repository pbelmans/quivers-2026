  title: Resolutions of near-thin quiver moduli
  abstract: In this talk, we translate Seshadri's resolution of the moduli space of vector bundles of rank $2$ and degree $0$ on a smooth projective curve to the setting of quiver moduli. This results in a resolution of the moduli space of $\theta$-polystable representations of $Q$ with dimension vector $\boldsymbol{d}$ in the case where $Q$ is any quiver, $d_i=2$ for all $i\in Q_0$, $\theta$ satisfies a genericity condition, and a $\theta$-stable representation of $Q$ with dimension vector $\boldsymbol{d}$ exists.

  title: Counting real sheaves on toric surfaces
  abstract: In 1991, Klyachko proved a beautiful formula calculating the Euler characteristic of the moduli space of rank-two stable torsion-free sheaves on the complex projective plane with given Chern class. His method uses toric geometry and has been expanded and applied to prove different versions of the same computation for other surfaces, giving insight also to wall-crossing phenomena which aren't visible on the projective plane. After motivating the problem and recalling the basic constructions involved, we describe a readaptation of these methods for the real projective plane which generalizes to real models of other toric surfaces.

  title: Dubrovin conjecture for the quiver moduli space $K_{(2,3)}^3$
  abstract: We investigate the moduli space $K_{(2,3)}^3$ of quiver representations for the 3-Kronecker quiver with dimension vector $(2,3)$. It is a blow-down of $\operatorname{Hilb}^3\mathbb{P}^2)$ and comes with interesting embeddings into Grassmannians, giving rise to the universal quiver representation. We construct an Aut-invariant full exceptional sequence for its derived category and calculate its small quantum cohomology ring. These allow us to verify the (refined) Dubrovin conjecture relating full Lefschetz collection of derived category to the generic semisimplicity of the big quantum cohomology ring. This is based on a joint work with Svetlana Makarova.

  title: Teleman quantisation applied to quiver moduli
  abstract: >
    <p>We apply Teleman quantization to the GIT construction of moduli spaces of representations of quivers. This allows us to prove that the universal bundle of fine quiver moduli spaces is a partial tilting object, confirming a conjecture of Schofield, and to give several constructions of strongly exceptional collections. Our results are effective and are implemented in the SageMath and Oscar computer algebra systems.
    <p>This talk is based on joint work with Pieter Belmans, Ana-Maria Brecan, Hans Franzen and Markus Reineke.

  title: Degree of a Fano quiver moduli space
  abstract: Given a quiver $Q$ and a dimension vector $\mathbf{d}$, the moduli space $X$ of $\theta$-stable representations of $Q$ with dimension vector $\mathbf{d}$ for some $\theta$ is a Fano variety if it satisfies a numerical condition. In this talk, we will explore how to compute the degree of $X$ in its Chow ring. One key technique is to reduce the calculation to the toric case where the dimension vector assigned to a quiver is 1. In the end, we will see a degree formula in the case of the bipartite quiver $K_{(2,q)}^m$.
